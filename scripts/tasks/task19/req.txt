### Task 1: Log Rotation Script
Create `log_rotate.sh` that:
1. Takes a log directory as an argument (e.g., `/var/log/myapp`)
2. Compresses `.log` files older than 7 days using `gzip`
3. Deletes `.gz` files older than 30 days
4. Prints how many files were compressed and deleted
5. Exits with an error if the directory doesn't exist
